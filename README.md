# UCL Project Generating normally distributed pseudo-random numbers 

Generating Standard Normals

Introduction:
In this project, we examine three methods for generating pseudo-random numbers. Specifically, we generate numbers that are distributed with the Gaussian (normal) distribution, starting from the random number generator of a computer. To check whether what we have generated is actually Gaussian or Pareto distributed, we apply various normality tests. Finally, to illustrate the applications of these methods, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation in which we calculate the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for a given portfolio.

Methods: 
• Inverse transform sampling
• Rejection sampling
• Box–Muller transformation

Programming language: 
Python
